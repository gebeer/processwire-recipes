Since processwire-recipes.com went down and never came back ðŸ˜” I decided to play around with all the ProcessWire Recipes and moved it over to a fresh new instance of 11ty running on Cloudflare Pages with a public Github Directory.

## ProcessWire Recipes Legacy (Github)

This project is based on the great work done [Marcus](https://marcus-herrmann.com/). As his project went offline some time ago I put it online again - in a different but similar way.

## ProcessWire Recipes 2023 (Github)

The new repository (based on the legacy version) can be found here.

Some day in the future additional recipes will be added from my personal collection.
