Since `processwire-recipes.com` went down and never came back ðŸ˜” I decided to play around with all the ProcessWire Recipes and moved it over to a fresh new instance of 11ty running on Cloudflare Pages with a public Github Directory.

**Update: 2023-03-05**

We now have full access to the old/former Github account and repository. In the near future there will be a slight change in submitting new recipes and changes.

## ProcessWire Recipes Legacy (Github)

This project is based on the great work done [Marcus](https://marcus-herrmann.com/). As his project went offline some time ago I put it online again - in a different but similar way.

- https://github.com/processwire-recipes/Recipes

## ProcessWire Recipes 2023 (Github)

The new repository (based on the legacy version) can be found here.

- https://github.com/webmanufaktur/processwire-recipes

Some day in the future additional recipes will be added from my personal collection.
