Since `processwire-recipes.com` went down and never came back üòî I decided to play around with all the **ProcessWire Recipes** and moved it over to a fresh new instance of **11ty** running on **Cloudflare Pages** from within a public Github Directory.

## Recent changes

See more updates in our [changelog](/changelog/).

### Update: 2023-03-05

We now have full access to the old/former Github account and repository. In the near future there will be a slight change in submitting new recipes and changes.

### Update: 2023-03-11

[processwire.recipes](https://processwire.recipes/) is our new home now.

While this is already awesome we will soon switch back to the [old official Github repo](https://github.com/processwire-recipes/Recipes) but with a new markdown format for upcoming recipes and updates.
