### ✅ Recipe updates and snippets

Merged a few recipe updates from **@gebeer** today, while he also already created the [first batch](https://github.com/webmanufaktur/processwire-recipes/pull/3) of possible **VS Code Recipe Snippets** -- for the moment totally untested. So if anyone wants to take a look at them and test them. Let us know.

### ✅ _Design_ tweaks

[As Ivan mentioned](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/7572-processwire-recipes/page/4/#comment-231355) -- for a very good reason -- in the forums already... the design had and has some flaws. Some of those were just fixed with this latest update. Yet some are still in the pipeline. But at the end we will get there and have a nice interface to browse all recipes and future content. Keep in mind that desktop will have the focus here, as most of us work on full setup. Yet... mobile for a quick research will be implemented.

In case you want to jump in... watch our [Github](https://github.com/processwire-recipes/) for the upcoming www/11ty setup repository containing all layout files.

## ℹ️ 2023-03-11

In the last few days [@marcus](https://processwire.com/talk/profile/912-marcus/) and I talked and he made me a member and owner of the _old_ [organization account on Github](https://github.com/processwire-recipes/) so we can still use the old/former official repository - that's **awesome**!

Yet... the old domain is long gone. I tried to contact the new owner but no chance so far. Even through buyback-services and domainer/s.

### 💯 New domain

That's why I bought the [processwire.recipes](https://processwire.recipes/) domain - so I hope it was worth it. 😉

### ℹ️ Upcoming changes

I will update all recipes to the new markdown format, while keeping a copy of the legacy version in a separate branch/version. I will update all guides on how to submit and update recipes in the next few days.

## 2023-03-05

We now have full access to the old/former Github account and repository. In the near future there will be a slight change in submitting new recipes and changes.

## 2023-03-11

[processwire.recipes](https://processwire.recipes/) is our new home now. While this is already awesome we will soon switch back to the [old official Github repo](https://github.com/processwire-recipes/Recipes) but with a new markdown format for upcoming recipes and updates.

See: [Forum announcement](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/7572-processwire-recipes/page/3/#comment-231247)
